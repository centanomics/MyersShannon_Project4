# DWS2 Kanban Board

Welcome to the starter repo for your Kanban board application ðŸš€!

You'll want to customize this readme file a bit to contain information about the project, but for now here is what you need to know to get set up:

## Installation

Make sure you have the following:

- Node
- NPM

From the root of this project run: `npm install`. This will pull in the dependencies needed for development.

Next Install gulp by typing `npm install gulp` in the console, still in the root of the project.

Then install gulp-sass by typing `npm install gulp-sass` in the console.

Finally, install browser-sync by typing in `npm install browser-sync` in the console.

## Usage

- `npm start`: This command will start up a local web server, open your default browser, and begin watching scss, html, and js files for changes.
- `gulp`: Will do the same as the above command.
- `npm run build`: This command will only compile your scss files.

## Things to know

You can customize the structure of this project however you like. A base set of functionality has been provided to get you started. Make sure to familiarize yourself with what's going on in the `gulpfile.js`.
